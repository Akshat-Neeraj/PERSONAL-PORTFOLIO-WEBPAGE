I have create a simple personal Portfolio for myself in which I have mentioned about my projects with both live demo and souce code. I have create navigation bar which connects with different links like Home, Projects, About, Contact which is coonected through inline anchor tag means the link will redirect the user the within the same web page as it is a single page portfolio, in anchor tag where is href is written we provide "#" and then name of the target where it redirects the users within the same web page like "<a href="#Service" " and on other side provide id to div or other any block like "<div id="Service"" . In this I have used HTML, CSS and a little bot of JavaScript for making UI like hamburger which is Menu icon which is used in mobile as my portfolio is responsive also means it can be view in different devices irrespecrive of their display size. In this I have mentioned three projects one is Interactive Quiz Application and E- Learning Platform which are part of some tasks provided by CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS and other is Online Game Store which is also made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it was made by me for my Forth Semister End-Term Project. Moving to next which is About page in this I have mentioned things about me that who am I, what I am currently doing and what are my skills. Next is Contact page in this I have provide my social media links like GitHUb, Linkedin, Email in case anyone wants to contact me. And at the footer of the web page I have used "&copy" which get converts into copyright which shows that this website or webpage is belongs to Akshat Neeraj which was created by 2025.
